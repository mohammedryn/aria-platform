# Gemini Prompt Templates for A.R.I.A.

# Natural language chat prompt (default mode)
natural_language: |
  You are A.R.I.A. (Autonomous Retrieval & Intelligence Agent), an intelligent robotic assistant.
  You can see through cameras and help with workspace manipulation tasks.
  
  Respond naturally and helpfully to questions about what you see.
  Be specific and accurate. If you're unsure about something, say so clearly.
  Keep responses concise but informative.

# Scene analysis prompt (detailed understanding)
scene_analysis: |
  Analyze this robotic workspace image. Provide:
  
  1. Overall scene description
  2. All visible objects (with approximate positions)
  3. Spatial relationships (X is on top of Y, Z is blocking W)
  4. Any safety concerns (liquids, fragile items, hot objects)
  5. Workspace status (clear, cluttered, organized)
  
  Be detailed and precise. Respond naturally.

# Object detection prompt (structured JSON output)
object_detection: |
  You are helping a robotic system identify objects for manipulation.
  Analyze this workspace image and list ALL visible objects.
  
  For each object provide:
  - name: Specific name (e.g., "blue marker" not just "marker")
  - position: Location description (e.g., "center-left, near camera")
  - properties: Notable characteristics (e.g., "standing upright", "partially visible")
  
  Respond ONLY as valid JSON:
  {
    "objects": [
      {"name": "...", "position": "...", "properties": "..."},
      ...
    ]
  }
  
  If no objects visible, return: {"objects": []}

# Task planning prompt (multi-step reasoning)
task_planning: |
  You are planning actions for a 5-DOF robotic arm.
  
  WORKSPACE STATE:
  {scene_description}
  
  USER COMMAND:
  "{user_command}"
  
  Break this into executable steps:
  1. Consider what objects might block others
  2. Plan removal sequence if needed
  3. Determine optimal grasp approaches
  4. Check workspace boundaries
  
  Respond as JSON array of steps:
  [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "move_obstacle/grasp/place",
      "target": "object name",
      "reasoning": "why this step is needed"
    },
    ...
  ]
  
  If task is impossible, explain why.

# Grasp evaluation prompt (error recovery)
grasp_evaluation: |
  I attempted to grasp an object. Compare these two images:
  
  BEFORE: Image before grasp attempt
  AFTER: Image after grasp attempt
  
  Target object: {target_object}
  
  Analyze:
  1. Did the grasp succeed?
  2. If failed, what went wrong?
  3. What is the current state of the object?
  4. How should I adjust my approach?
  
  Respond as JSON:
  {
    "success": true/false,
    "object_state": "grasped/missed/knocked_over/rolled_away",
    "diagnosis": "what happened",
    "correction": {
      "action": "retry/reposition/different_approach",
      "specific_adjustment": "detailed instruction"
    }
  }

# Safety assessment prompt
safety_assessment: |
  Assess the safety of this robotic workspace:
  
  Look for:
  - Liquid spills (could damage electronics)
  - Hot objects (could cause burns)
  - Fragile items (risk of breaking)
  - Sharp objects (safety hazard)
  - Obstacles blocking robot movement
  - Objects near workspace edges (fall risk)
  
  Respond as JSON:
  {
    "safe": true/false,
    "hazards": ["description of each hazard", ...],
    "recommendations": ["safety action to take", ...]
  }

# Spider terrain assessment prompt  
terrain_assessment: |
  This is from a mobile robot's camera looking ahead.
  Assess the terrain for safe navigation:
  
  1. Is it safe to proceed forward?
  2. Any edges or drops detected?
  3. Surface type (smooth, textured, cluttered)
  4. Visible obstacles
  5. Any objects of interest?
  
  Respond as JSON:
  {
    "safe_to_proceed": true/false,
    "hazards": ["edge at 20cm", "obstacle ahead", ...],
    "surface_quality": "good/fair/poor",
    "recommendation": "proceed/turn_left/turn_right/stop"
  }
